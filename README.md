An app in Flutter which helps in providing a platform for
the students to view upcoming events, attend webinars hosted by institutions,
ask doubts in them, review the recorded lectures and discuss among peer
students.
On the other hand, the institutions can also schedule meetings and view the
analytics of the students attendance.
All this is possible with the help of Flutter, Firebase and Zego-UIKit.
